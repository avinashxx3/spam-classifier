    "The first step in every machine learning algorithm is to process the raw data in some meaningful representations. We will be using the [Bag-of-Words](https://towardsdatascience.com/a-simple-explanation-of-the-bag-of-words-model-b88fc4f4971) representation to process the text. It comprises of following steps:\n",

    "- Process emails line-by-line to extract all the words.\n",
    "- Replace extracted words by their stem (root) word. This is known as stemming and lematization.\n",
    "- Remove stop words like and, or, is, am, and so on.\n",
    "- Assign a unique index to each word. This forms the vocabulary.\n",
